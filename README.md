# Food Doctor

This is a mobile application developed using Flutter and Firebase. 

It scans barcodes on shelf-bought products, then matches them to the user's preferences before it determines if it is safe to eat.  I utilized 2 different APIs, which are openFoodFacts and Edamam, to achieve this goal. 

Unfortunately, its development was cut short due to the company responsible for it stopping production, so this is more like an 80 % finished product.
